# Velo [![CI](https://github.com/boreq/velo/workflows/CI/badge.svg)][actions]

A self-hosted alternative to activity tracking websites.


## Where is the frontend code?

The frontend lives in [another repository][frontend-repository]. It is built
separately and then embedded in the backend's source code.
